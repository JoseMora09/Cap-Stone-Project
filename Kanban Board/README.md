# Kanban Board

# What the application does <br/>
A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency. It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done.

## Technology chosen <br/>
The application is developed using only the ReactJS with `create-react-app` package. The application is using browsers `localStorage` to store all the data. Its saving it with name `kanban-store` in local storage.

## Features hope to implement in the future <br/>
Attach files to each task if needed. Add dependencies to each card.   

## Install and Run <br/>
1) Install packages - to install the packages, open the code in VS Code and open a Terminal here. Then run command `npm install` and wait for it to finish. This operation is required only once. <br/>
2) Start application - after istallation is completed, you can start the application by running the command `npm start` it will automatically open a browser and show your app running <br/>
